# liri-node-app 

This app requires using nodeJS and a few other packages to run, so check the package.json file for the dependencies.

The commands are:
1) 'spotify-this-song' and a song name (if no name is provided, the default is searched);
2) 'movie-this' and the title of a movie (if no name is provided, the default is searched);
3) 'concert-this' and the name of a band, if there are no concerts for the band you will get a response saying so.
4) 'do-what-it-says' takes the random.txt file and reads the one line in it to run one of the previous 3 commands.

Here is a link to screenshots of how the project works. Enjoy!
